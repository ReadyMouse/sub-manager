# Project Overview

SubChain is a decentralized subscription management protocol that brings familiar "set and forget" recurring payments to cryptocurrency. The platform solves a critical pain point in the crypto ecosystem: the inability to easily manage recurring payments.

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Crypto users hold $150B+ in stablecoins but have no native way to manage subscriptions
- Subscriptions management ystems like Privacy.com with million of users is fiat-only
- Current solutions require locking funds in escrow (poor UX) or manual monthly payments (friction) or streaming micro-payments like Hyperliquid
- On-chain payment history is fully public, exposing sensitive subscription data
- No unified dashboard exists to view all crypto-based subscriptions in one place
- Recurring tax-deductable charitable donations via crypto (with on-chain proof)
- Recurring peer-to-peer transcations (rent, allowance, savings accounts, etc.)

**Our Solution:**
SubChain enables users to create subscriptions using PYUSD (PayPal's stablecoin) through the ERC-20 allowance pattern‚Äîsimilar to giving a gym ACH authorization to auto-charge your bank account each month. Money stays in the user's wallet until payment is due, preserving financial sovereignty while enabling the subscription economy. Chainlink Automation or Gelato Network monitors subscriptions and automatically triggers payments when due‚Äîtruly "set and forget" recurring payments. An Envio-powered indexer tracks all subscription events to provide a unified dashboard where users manage their subscriptions, view payment history, and receive balance warnings. Leveraging Hardhat's capibility to fork mainnet ETH for development. 

**Target Audience:** Crypto-native users who hold PYUSD and want to pay for subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, SaaS tools, etc.) without linking traditional bank accounts or credit cards.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Run the automated setup script to install dependencies and configure your environment:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
- ‚úì Check Node.js version (requires LTS: 22.x, 20.x, or 18.x)
- ‚úì Create `.env` file (you'll need to add your Alchemy API key)
- ‚úì Install all Hardhat and project dependencies
- ‚úì Compile contracts
- ‚úì Verify setup

**After running setup.sh:**
1. Get free Alchemy API key from https://www.alchemy.com/
2. Add it to your `.env` file
3. Run `npm test` to verify everything works

## Hackathon Positioning
"Hi judges, I'm going to show you how crypto subscriptions 
should work...

[Opens SubChain.xyz]

Here's our marketplace - think Bitrefill meets Netflix. 
I can browse any subscription service...

[Clicks Netflix]

SubChain automatically determines the best way to pay:
- For Netflix: Gift card API (automated)
- For Dune Analytics: Direct integration (native)
- For anything else: Virtual card bridge (universal)

Watch me subscribe to Netflix with PYUSD...

[Approves PYUSD allowance]
[Creates subscription]

Instantly indexed by Envio...

[Dashboard updates in real-time]

Gift card purchased via Bitrefill...
[Show API response]

Now, my browser extension detects the gift card is ready...
[Extension icon lights up]

I click 'Auto-Redeem'...
[Puppeteer window pops up]

Watch it log in and redeem automatically...
[Shows browser automating the redemption]

Done! Netflix renewed without me doing anything.
[Shows Netflix account with updated balance]"


## Market 

Privacy.com has proven people want unified subscription management‚Äîthey have millions of users. But they're 100% fiat. We're building the crypto-native version for the 500M+ people holding stablecoins who want to pay with PYUSD instead of linking their bank account.

## Integrations to Consider

* Unlock Protocol 
* Alchemy -> used for this project
* Mintstars -> showcase the privacy aspects with encrypted label
* Bitrefill/Coinsbee -> requires manual code entry
* Charity that accepts crypto (TLC?) 

## Privacy-Preserving Subscriptions

Keep payments on-chain but encrypt subscription metadata

### The Problem
Traditional on-chain subscriptions expose:
‚ùå What services you use
‚ùå How much you spend
‚ùå Your entire subscription history

### Our Solution: Client-Side Encryption
‚úÖ Subscription details encrypted before hitting blockchain
‚úÖ Only you can decrypt with your password/key
‚úÖ Blockchain only sees: amounts, timing, addresses
‚úÖ No one can tell OnlyFans from Netflix from Spotify

### Privacy Guarantees
- Service names: PRIVATE
- Categories: PRIVATE  
- Payment amounts: PUBLIC (required for smart contract)
- Payment timing: PUBLIC (required for automation)

### Future: Full ZK Privacy
With more time, we'd implement zk-SNARKs to hide amounts too.
Technologies:

* Noir (Aztec's ZK language) - beginner-friendly
* Circom + SnarkJS - more established
* zk-SNARKs on EVM - native support on some chains

## Hackathon requirments
### Envio
Best Use of HyperIndex ‚∏∫ $1,500
Awarded to the team that best demonstrates the creative use of HyperIndex, Envio‚Äôs high-performance, multichain indexing framework. We will look for clear schema design, optimized event handling, and meaningful data querying. 

Qualification Requirements:

- Deployment to the hosted service (please reachout if you need production resources)
- Clear usage in your application

### Hardhat ‚∏∫ $2,500

Usage of a Hardhat release 3.0.0*. Usage of Hardhat 2 releases won't qualify.

### Paypal

ü•á Grand Prize (Best Overall Transformative Use of PYUSD) ‚∏∫ $4,500
Awarded to the project that most convincingly demonstrates a powerful and scalable real-world use case for PYUSD. The winner will set a new benchmark for digital payments, showing how PYUSD unlocks unique value‚Äîwhether by powering global remittances, revolutionizing commerce, or creating new economic opportunities. 

OR 

üéñÔ∏è PYUSD Consumer Champion (Best Consumer-Focused Payments Experience) ‚∏∫ $3,500
This prize recognizes the project  that builds the most seamless and engaging consumer payment experience with PYUSD at its core. From streamlining cross-border settlements, to enabling microtransactions, **programmable subscriptions**, or ‚Äúpay-as-you-go‚Äù economics, we want to see fresh ideas that push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in digital payments. Think outside the box‚Äîyour solution should inspire new thinking for the entire PYUSD ecosystem.

NOTE

Each Project Submission will be judged by a panel of judges in accordance with the following criteria: 
(a) Functionality: How well does this Project Submission work? What is the quality of the code? 
(b) Payments Applicability: How effectively does the solution address real-world payment challenges? 
(c) Novelty: How unique is this Project Submission‚Äôs concept? 
(d) UX: How well does this Project Submission utilize PYUSD‚Äôs performance and unique proposition to create great UX for downstream users? 
(e) Open-source: Is this Project Submission open-source? How well does the Project Submission compose with other primitives in the ecosystem? 
(f) Business Plan: Is there a viable business that can be built in the future around this Submission? 

Qualification Requirements

1. Submission must clearly demonstrate utilization of PYUSD (deployed on mainnet or testnet)
2. Project must be newly built and deployed.
3. Include a public code repo; if private, share access credentials
4. Submit a 2‚Äì4 minute demo video explaining and showcasing the project
5. Project must be original

## Note

Cursor + Claude AI was used to support development. 

## Things I'll need to deal with later:

- Handling of fees (user approves $15/mo to Netflix, who pays the fee)
- ETH/SOL fees for PYUSD transcations (this is why normies hate crypto)
