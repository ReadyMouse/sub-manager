  "description": "Project Summary: **StableRent - Universal Crypto Subscription Manager** StableRent is a decentralized subscription management protocol that brings  familiar \"set and forget\" recurring payments to crypto. Users create  subscriptions by approving the StableRent smart contract to spend **PYUSD**  (PayPal's stablecoin) directly from their wallet using the ERC-20 allowance  pattern—similar to giving a gym ACH authorization to auto-charge your bank  account each month. When a subscription payment becomes due (based on the  billing interval), the service provider or an automation bot calls the  contract's ```processPayment()``` function, which pulls the exact subscription  mount from the user's wallet and transfers it to the service provider. The  smart contract tracks billing cycles, handles failed payments gracefully  (auto-canceling after consecutive failures), and allows users to cancel anytime. **Envio** indexes all subscription events to power a unified dashboard where users see all their active subscriptions, upcoming payments, balance warnings, and payment history in one place. Built with **Hardhat** for development and testing, the platform solves crypto's recurring payment problem without requiring users to lock funds in escrow—money stays in their wallet until payment is due, preserving financial sovereignty while enabling the subscription economy.",
